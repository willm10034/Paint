# Paint
Simple paint program in python, qt5, and opencv

Core code taken from paint program examples for qt5. I added extra tools like line, reactangle, flood fill, ellipse, eye dropper.
Interface for color pick, tool selection, and tool weight done using opencv. (paint_pallete.jpg required)

To run...

pip3 install opencv-python pyqt5 pillow numpy

python3 paint.py
